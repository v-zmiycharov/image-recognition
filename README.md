# About

Image recognition using Convolutional neural networks.
Master's Thesis for Information retrieval and data mining in Sofia University.
It is developed using Python and keras with tensorflow backend (PyCharm as IDE).

# Configuration

## Install requirements:
* Linux based OS
* Python v3+
* CUDA toolkit 8.0
* CuDNN v5
* Tensorflow

Detailed info: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup (Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit, GPU enabled, Python 3.4)

## Implementation
* common: Experiments, unnecessary stuff
* src: Main source folder
* src/pretrained: Downloaded fully trained CNN stuff
* src/data/image_crawler: Download 56 synsets from ImageNet to folder relative to src folder (If error occurs: create folder _DATA next to src and folder ImageNet in _DATA)
* src/data/bin_generator: Resize and generate binary files for images so that they can be directly passed to CNN. (If error occurs create _MODELS folder next to src)
* src/main/train: Train a CNN for the images generated by bin_generator
* src/main/eval: Evaluates generated model and produces output for each class
* src/config: Configurations including number of classes, disable cross validation etc ..
